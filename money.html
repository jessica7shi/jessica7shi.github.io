		<div id="overview">
			Chinese money plants have unusual round green leaves, which are just adorable when decorating a desk or a room. Wild chinese money plants are found only in China, specifically in the Sichuan and Yunnan province. They are also easy to propogate. Little offshoots will appear next to the original plant, still connected to the original root system. Chinese money plants are a little difficult to find in plant nurseries, so find a friend with offshoots!

			Light: These plants enjoy being in indirect bright light. This is because direct light will burn their round leaves. Rotate the plant regularly to keep the plant relatively symmetrical.

			Water: When watering, water throughly. If the leaves start to look droopy, the plant needs water. The soil needs to dry out between waterings, but you should mist them weekly to get rid of dust on the leaves. Make sure the pot and soil drain well to avoid killing the plant.
